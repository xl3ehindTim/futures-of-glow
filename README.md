# Futures of GLOW
Imagine having the opportunity to create a light artwork. Would you revert to previous artworks youâ€™ve seen, perhaps even (un)consciously imitating elements of them? Or would you set your creative mind free, unrestricted by any limitations? This is what our project Futures of GLOW provided visitors of this light art festival. 

Visitors got the opportunity to create their own light artworks by making use of our project. To provide visitors with this we made use of Stable Diffusion with LoRA models trained on images of the city Eindhoven and previous years of the GLOW festival. After each day of the festival we created a timelapse so that visitors could see their artwork shine bright once more, you can find the timelapses [here](https://linktr.ee/futuresofglow).

Finally, the most important part of our project was that the whole city Eindhoven could see these light artworks by displaying them on a huge billboard!
